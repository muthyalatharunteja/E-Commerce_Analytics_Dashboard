## 📌 Overview

A complete analytics pipeline that transforms raw e-commerce data into actionable business insights — covering **customer behavior**, **revenue performance**, **delivery efficiency**, and **time-based purchasing patterns**.

The project demonstrates real-world data engineering skills: from ingesting raw CSV data into BigQuery, through advanced SQL modeling with window functions, to polished interactive Tableau dashboards.

Built using a 3-layer data architecture (Raw → Staging → Analytics) in Google BigQuery to ensure scalable and reproducible data processing.

## 🎯 Business Problem

Despite strong revenue, the business lacked visibility into key operational areas:

| Problem Area | Description |
|---|---|
| 🔁 Retention | Why do customers not return after their first purchase? |
| 💰 Customer Value | How is revenue distributed across customer segments? |
| 🚚 Delivery | Where are the inefficiencies and outliers in the delivery process? |
| ⏰ Timing | When are customers most active, and how should campaigns be timed? |

## 🗂️ Data Source

**Dataset:** [Olist Brazilian E-Commerce](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce) (Kaggle)

Covers orders from **2016–2018**, including:

- 📦 ~100K orders
- 👥 Customer profiles
- 💳 Payment records
- 🚚 Delivery timestamps

---

## 🧠 Data Model

### Core Tables
| Table | Description |
|---|---|
| `fact_orders` | Central fact table with order-level data |
| `dim_customers` | Customer dimension with RFM segmentation |

### KPI Tables
| Table | Description |
|---|---|
| `kpi_revenue_summary` | Revenue aggregations over time |
| `kpi_delivery_performance` | Delivery time, delay metrics, and outlier flags |
| `kpi_rfm` | Recency, Frequency, Monetary segmentation scores |
| `kpi_cohort_analysis` | Monthly cohort retention rates |
| `kpi_time_analysis` | Hourly, daily, and heatmap order patterns |

---

## 🔥 Advanced SQL — Key Highlight

Window functions power the dynamic analytics layer, enabling percentage contributions, rankings, and time-based metrics without subqueries:

```sql
-- Time analysis: rank peak hours and calculate order share
SELECT
  EXTRACT(HOUR FROM order_date)            AS hour,
  COUNT(*)                                 AS orders,
  COUNT(*) * 100.0 / SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER () AS order_percentage,
  RANK() OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC)     AS order_rank
FROM fact_orders
GROUP BY hour;
```

**Techniques used across the project:**

| Function | Use Case |
|---|---|
| `RANK() / DENSE_RANK()` | Identify peak hours and top segments |
| `SUM() OVER()` | Order and revenue contribution % |
| `DATE_DIFF()` | Recency scoring and delivery duration |
| `CASE WHEN` | RFM segmentation and delay categorisation |

## 📊 Dashboards

### 1. 🏠 Business Overview

Key performance metrics and revenue trend across 2016–2018, with customer segmentation breakdown.

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Total Revenue | **€15.84M** |
| Total Orders | **~98.67K** |
| Avg Order Value | **€3.23K** |
| Repeat Rate | **3.05%** |

> **Insight:** Revenue grew strongly through 2017 into early 2018. Low-value customers (94.4K) dominate volume, but high-value customers (1.1K) punch above their weight in total spend.

---

### 2. 🚚 Delivery Performance

Delivery time distribution, on-time vs. late breakdown, and outlier detection.

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Avg Delivery Time | **~13 days** |
| On-Time Delivery Rate | **93.45%** |
| Avg Delay Percentage | **6.55%** |
| Max Observed Delay | **209 days** |

**Delay Categories:**

| Category | Orders |
|---|---|
| On Time | 48.78K |
| 1–2 Days Late | 0.61K |
| 3–5 Days Late | 0.59K |
| 5+ Days Late | 1.69K |

> **Insight:** > Insight: The delivery system is efficient overall, but a small number of extreme delays create a long-tail distribution, significantly impacting average delivery time.

### 3. 📉 Advanced Analytics — Cohort & RFM

Cohort retention analysis and RFM customer segmentation.

**Cohort Analysis:**
- Retention drops sharply after the first purchase across all cohorts
- ~80–90% of customers do not return after their first purchase, indicating a retention-driven revenue gap.

**RFM Segmentation:**

| Segment | Customers |
|---|---|
| High Value | ~0.1K |
| Medium Value | ~20.5K |
| Low Value | ~74.9K |

> **Insight:** Over 85% of customers are low-value. Medium-value customers (20.5K) represent the highest growth opportunity — targeted upsell campaigns could meaningfully shift revenue.

### 4. ⏰ Time Analysis — Peak Activity During Daytime Hours

Hourly trends, day-of-week patterns, and a day–hour heatmap to identify peak activity windows.

| Metric | Finding |
|---|---|
| Peak Hour | **4 PM** (7.65K orders) |
| Active Window | **10 AM – 9 PM** |
| Strongest Day | **Monday** (18.39K orders) |
| Weakest Day | **Saturday** (12.17K orders) |

**Patterns from the heatmap:**
- Early morning (0–7 AM): consistently low activity across all days
- Midday–evening (10 AM–9 PM): sustained high volume, especially Mon–Wed
- Weekend afternoons show a noticeable drop-off vs. weekdays

> **Insight:** Customer activity is strongly tied to working hours and the start of the week. Marketing campaigns and promotions should be concentrated in the 10 AM–9 PM window, with emphasis on Monday and Tuesday.

## 📈 Key Insights Summary

| Area | Insight |
|---|---|
| ⏰ **Timing** | Peak activity 10 AM–9 PM; strongest Mon–Tue, weakest Saturday |
| 👥 **Retention** | ~80–90% of customers never return after their first purchase |
| 💰 **Revenue** | Driven by high volume of low-value customers; high-value are few but impactful |
| 🚚 **Delivery** | 93.45% on time; extreme outliers skew average delivery time to 13 days |
| 📊 **Segments** | Medium-value customers (20.5K) are the best conversion opportunity |

---

## 💡 Business Recommendations

1. **🔁 Boost Retention** — Implement post-purchase email flows, loyalty programmes, and re-engagement campaigns targeting lapsed customers
2. **📈 Convert Medium → High Value** — Identify medium-value customers' purchase patterns and build targeted upsell/cross-sell sequences
3. **⏰ Optimise Campaign Timing** — Concentrate ad spend between 10 AM–9 PM, prioritising Monday and Tuesday
4. **🚚 Investigate Delivery Outliers** — Audit logistics partners responsible for 60+ day delays; set automated SLA alerts
5. **🎯 Personalise with RFM** — Tailor messaging by segment: reward champions, re-engage at-risk, nurture medium-value prospects
